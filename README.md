# Hi, I'm Rudmehr Aghakhani üëã

I am a Bachelor of Science student in Computer Engineering at the University of Isfahan, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

My primary passion lies at the intersection of **Quantum Computing** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I am focused on developing and optimizing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to solve complex problems in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP), and computational science.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. (B.Sc. Thesis) Generative Quantum GNN for Drug Discovery

This project involves the synthesis and optimization of a Quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN) processor.
* **Goal:** To build a generative model (a Quantum Graph Variational Autoencoder, or QGVAE) capable of designing novel molecular inhibitors for the KRAS cancer protein.
* **Innovation:** A core focus is the **Hardware-Aware Synthesis** of the quantum processor (PQC). The circuit's entanglement map is designed to match the physical connectivity of real quantum hardware (like IBM's Guadalupe) to minimize SWAP gates and quantum cost.
**Technologies:** PennyLane, PyTorch Geometric, Qiskit, RDKit, AutoDock Vina.

### 2. (Internship) AI-Optimized Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

During my internship at the University of Isfahan's Quantum Science and Technology Center, I developed an ML model to optimize the parameters for the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol.
* **Key Achievement:** I identified a critical flaw in the standard `OpenQKDSecurity` simulation toolkit, discovering its internal optimization module produced unreliable results.
* **Solution:** I pivoted the project to first generate a reliable ground-truth dataset using a robust numerical optimization algorithm (`Dual Annealing`), which was then used to successfully train the predictive ML model.
* **Technologies:** TensorFlow/Keras, Python, Dual Annealing, VHDL/FPGA (conceptual design).

### 3. Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) Implementation

This project explored the implementation of QNLP tasks by mapping grammatical structures directly onto parameterized quantum circuits.
***Framework:** Utilized the **DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical)** framework, which models the meaning of a sentence based on its grammatical composition.
***Applications:** Successfully implemented two core QNLP tasks: **Sentiment Classification** and **Next-Word Prediction**.
* [cite_start]**Technologies:** `lambeq`, `DisCoPy`, Qiskit, PennyLane.
